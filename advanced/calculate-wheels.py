""""
First find possible combinations by hand and look for a possible pattern.

After a couple of tries, confirmed that if the N is divisible by 4, you get(N/4)+1 possible combinations.

And after noticing that dividing N by 4 with remainder 2 will not change the outcome, so I added it as a base case. As well asÂ another base case for N = 2 because it only has 1 combination.

And lastly, ignored reminders equal to 3 or 1, because they don't have a possible combination.
